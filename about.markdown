I am a data scientist by profession, a physicist and a mathematician by training. I started my career in academia and went on to earn a PhD in theoretical and computational condensed. During my studies I focused on studying localized states in photonic crystals and photonic quasicrystals.

My first introduction to programming was during my time at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://www.aims.ac.za) in Cape Town, South Africa, 2009. In 2012 I started a professional career as a software developer in [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) South Africa. As my career progressed, my horizon opened to new worlds. I learnt about solving business and real-life problems. After a short while I realized that data is the new gold.

I took my first steps into the world of data when I moved to the big data team at [DSTV digital media](https://www.dstv.com) in 2015. I learnt about data engineering and building large scale distributed systems. In 2019 I moved to the financial sector to work as a data scientist at [Nedbank](https://www.nedbank.co.za). At the bank I started building regular propensity models, but quickly progressed into building uplift models and causal inference.

Throughout my career I worked with some amazing and talented people that helped shape my perspective about business, technology and science. In this blog I try to share my experiences and learnings. I write about the different approaches and techniques followed in solving problems and my take on them.

I hope the readers will find it useful and it will trigger some insightful conversations.
